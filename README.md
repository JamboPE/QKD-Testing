<h1>Quantum Key Distribution (BB84) Visualisation and Basic Simulation</h1>
<h4><i>Written by Jamie</i></h4>
<p>This script is to visualise and simulate, on a basic level, how the quantum key distribution protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06557">BB84</a> and error correction protocol <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48285-7_35">cascade</a> are used to create, distribute and error correct a private encryption key.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that two people, conventionally called Alice and Bob, want to communicate a secret securely. To do this they use the BB84 protocol to generate a private encryption key that can be used to encrypt their non-quantum secret. More information can be found in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06557">this research paper</a>.</p>
