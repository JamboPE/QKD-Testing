    "<p style=\"margin-bottom:1.5cm;\">The basic premise is that two people, conventionally called Alice and Bob, want to communicate a secret securely. To do this they use the BB84 protocol to generate a private encryption key that can be used to encrypt their non-quantum secret. More information can be found in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06557\">this research paper</a>.</p>\n",
